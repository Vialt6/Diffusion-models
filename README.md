#  Diffusion Model for Face Generation

This repository contains an implementation of a state-of-the-art diffusion model tailored for generating high-quality, realistic face images. Diffusion models have recently emerged as a powerful class of generative models, rivaling traditional methods like GANs (Generative Adversarial Networks) in both performance and fidelity.
